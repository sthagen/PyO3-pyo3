# Using `async` and `await`

*This feature is still in active development. See [the related issue](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1632).*

`#[pyfunction]` and `#[pymethods]` attributes also support `async fn`.

```rust
# #![allow(dead_code)]
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
use futures::channel::oneshot;
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
async fn sleep(seconds: f64, result: Option<PyObject>) -> Option<PyObject> {
    let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds));
        tx.send(()).unwrap();
    });
    rx.await.unwrap();
    result
}
```

*Python awaitables instantiated with this method can only be awaited in *asyncio* context. Other Python async runtime may be supported in the future.*

## `Send + 'static` constraint

Resulting future of an `async fn` decorated by `#[pyfunction]` must be `Send + 'static` to be embedded in a Python object.

As a consequence, `async fn` parameters and return types must also be `Send + 'static`, so it is not possible to have a signature like `async fn does_not_compile(arg: &PyAny, py: Python<'_>) -> &PyAny`.

It also means that methods cannot use `&self`/`&mut self`, *but this restriction should be dropped in the future.*


## Implicit GIL holding

Even if it is not possible to pass a `py: Python<'_>` parameter to `async fn`, the GIL is still held during the execution of the future â€“ it's also the case for regular `fn` without `Python<'_>`/`&PyAny` parameter, yet the GIL is held.

It is still possible to get a `Python` marker using [`Python::with_gil`]({{#PYO3_DOCS_URL}}/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.with_gil); because `with_gil` is reentrant and optimized, the cost will be negligible.

## Release the GIL across `.await`

There is currently no simple way to release the GIL when awaiting a future, *but solutions are currently in development*.

Here is the advised workaround for now:

```rust,ignore
use std::{future::Future, pin::{Pin, pin}, task::{Context, Poll}};
use pyo3::prelude::*;

struct AllowThreads<F>(F);

impl<F> Future for AllowThreads<F>
where
    F: Future + Unpin + Send,
    F::Output: Send,
{
    type Output = F::Output;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        let waker = cx.waker();
        Python::with_gil(|gil| {
            gil.allow_threads(|| pin!(&mut self.0).poll(&mut Context::from_waker(waker)))
        })
    }
}
```

## Cancellation

*To be implemented*

## The `Coroutine` type

To make a Rust future awaitable in Python, PyO3 defines a [`Coroutine`]({{#PYO3_DOCS_URL}}/pyo3/coroutine/struct.Coroutine.html) type, which implements the Python [coroutine protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Coroutine). Each `coroutine.send` call is translated to `Future::poll` call, while `coroutine.throw` call reraise the exception *(this behavior will be configurable with cancellation support)*.

*The type does not yet have a public constructor until the design is finalized.*
