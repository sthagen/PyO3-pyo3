The `Iter(A)NextOutput` types are now deprecated and `__(a)next__` can directly return anything which can be converted into Python objects, i.e. awaitables do not need to be wrapped into `IterANextOutput` or `Option` any more. `Option` can still be used as well and returning `None` will trigger the fast path for `__next__`, stopping iteration without having to raise a `StopIteration` exception.
