* Added an `ffi::compat` namespace to store compatibility shims for C API
  functions added in recent versions of Python.

* Added bindings for `PyDict_GetItemRef` on Python 3.13 and newer. Also added
  `ffi::compat::PyDict_GetItemRef` which re-exports the FFI binding on Python
  3.13 or newer and defines a compatibility version on older versions of
  Python. This function is inherently safer to use than `PyDict_GetItem` and has
  an API that is easier to use than `PyDict_GetItemWithError`. It returns a
  strong reference to value, as opposed to the two older functions which return
  a possibly unsafe borrowed reference.
